# Shutdown of RPAN

The shutdown of the Reddit Public Access Network occurred five days after it began on <time datetime="2019-08-24T01:00:00.000Z">8/23/2019, 9:00:00 PM</time>. 15 seconds later, u/fuzzypercentage (an admin) posted, distinguished, and stickied [Good night RPAN!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pan/comments/cum45p/good_night_rpan/). Afterwards, users lost access to the RPAN experiment, meaning UI elements would disappear and all attempts to access [/rpan](https://www.reddit.com/rpan) would result in the text 'Not Found' appearing.
